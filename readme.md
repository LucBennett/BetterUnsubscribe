## Unsubscribe

This extension adds a button to the navigation bar, if the email has an unsubscribe option in it's header.

Depending on the content of the header, different approaches of unsubscribing are used (only 1 at a time).
* 1. If 'List-Unsubscribe=One-Click' is available, an automatic push request is used
* 2. If there is an email address, an email is prepared for the user to be send
* 3. If there is a web address, the site is opened within the browser
